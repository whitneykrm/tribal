    <p>We’re a thoroughly new kind of hotel, which is why we call ourselves a House, as we aim to be a Melting Pot for getting people together for business or pleasure and because our way of doing things is perhaps just a little more personable and informal than some. And a touch off-beat: unusual cuisines; unexpected events; untypical meetings; unorthodox interiors; unconventional bedrooms; uncommon people.

        We have 83 bedrooms. 7 event and meeting spaces (some indoors and some out). 4 restaurants. An outdoor pool. A back garden. A gym. And lots of surprises to keep things buzzing.</p>

        <p>Four restaurants :</p>
            <p>- Copper: An urban open-fire grill.</p>
            <p>- The Living Room: A Kenyan coffee roastery and cafe.</p>
            <p>- The Other Room: An outdoors-in garden dining room.</p>
            <p>- Inca: A rooftop Peruvian restaurant celebrating Amazonian, Andean, Coastal and fusion cuisines.</p>

      <p>The Brand Values are:
        <p>Authenticity</p>
       <p>Resourcefulness</p> 
       <p>Craftsmanship</p> 
       <p>Sparkle</p>
